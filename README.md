Here are a few things that describe me:

- 💼&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm currently working full-time at [Basedash](https://www.basedash.com/) as a full-stack developer
- 📝&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got a web development blog that I no longer actively write on at [robertcooper.me](https://www.robertcooper.me/)
- 💬&nbsp;&nbsp; The two social platforms I'm active on are [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RobertCooper_RC) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-cooper/), where I mostly post about web development. Feel free to connect and reach out to me there.
- 🎾&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside of coding, I like to play tennis/pickleball, build things around the house, and bike with my dog
